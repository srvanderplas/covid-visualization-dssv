By March 2020, the virus had triggered a global pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020). In response to this crisis, governments have implemented unprecedented public health measures. The success of these policies will largely depend on the public's willingness to comply with new rules. A key factor in citizens’ willingness to comply is their understanding of the data that motivate government action. In this study, we examine how different ways of presenting these data visually can affect citizen's perceptions, attitudes and support for public policy.},

New examples of how ill-conceived or deliberately contrived statistical maps can greatly distort geographic reality demonstrate that lying with maps is a special case of lying with statistics. Issues addressed include the effects of map scale on geometry and feature selection, the importance of using a symbolization metaphor appropriate to the data and the power of data classification to either reveal meaningful spatial trends or promote misleading interpretations.},

 abstract = {Use of color for representing health data on maps raises many unanswered questions. This research addresses questions about which colors allow accurate map reading and which colors map users prefer. Through the combination of a review of previous color research and an experiment designed to test specific combinations of colors on maps, criteria were established and evaluated for selecting colors for choropleth maps of mortality data. The color-selection criteria provide pairs of hues for diverging schemes that avoid naming and colorblind confusions. We also tested sequential and spectral schemes. Our results show that color is worth the extra effort and expense it adds to map making because it permits greater accuracy in map reading. In addition, people prefer color maps over monochrome maps. Interestingly, scheme preference is affected by levels of clustering within mapped distributions. In this research, people preferred spectral and purple/green hue combinations. Contrary to our expectations, spectral schemes are effective if designed to include diverging lightness steps suited to the logical structure of mapped data. Diverging schemes produce better rate retrievals than both spectral and sequential schemes, however. In addition, diverging schemes place better emphasis on map clusters than sequential schemes. Thus map effectiveness is improved by use of diverging schemes. Our interdisciplinary research connects geographers with epidemiologists through concern about map symbolization and map reading, strengthening a significant area of collaboration. Providing guidelines that improve the design of customized color schemes will assist map makers in all disciplines in gaining insights about their data.},

abstract = {Abstract The manuscript introduces a framework for presenting the results of the statistical analysis of experiments with multiple responses and multiple factors. We propose a utilisation of factors scaling to enable a transformation that combines main effects, quadratic effects and interactions into a meaningful summary that allows the scientist/experimenter to immediately recognise the most influential factors for a given response. The framework does not replace the thorough evaluation of the results but provides a clear high-level summary of the relative importance of findings. The visualisation of such factor importance, using intensity heatmaps, allows the immediate understanding of the results across multiple responses that efficiently guides a following detailed analysis of certain responses and factors and contributes in designing subsequent experiments. The methodology is applied to a real industrial experiment and to a simulated data set with a larger number of responses and factors.},
