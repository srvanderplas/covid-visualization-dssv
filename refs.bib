By March 2020, the virus had triggered a global pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020). In response to this crisis, governments have implemented unprecedented public health measures. The success of these policies will largely depend on the public's willingness to comply with new rules. A key factor in citizens’ willingness to comply is their understanding of the data that motivate government action. In this study, we examine how different ways of presenting these data visually can affect citizen's perceptions, attitudes and support for public policy.},

New examples of how ill-conceived or deliberately contrived statistical maps can greatly distort geographic reality demonstrate that lying with maps is a special case of lying with statistics. Issues addressed include the effects of map scale on geometry and feature selection, the importance of using a symbolization metaphor appropriate to the data and the power of data classification to either reveal meaningful spatial trends or promote misleading interpretations.},

We propose a utilisation of factors scaling to enable a transformation that combines main effects, quadratic effects and interactions into a meaningful summary that allows the scientist/experimenter to immediately recognise the most influential factors for a given response. The framework does not replace the thorough evaluation of the results but provides a clear high-level summary of the relative importance of findings. The visualisation of such factor importance, using intensity heatmaps, allows the immediate understanding of the results across multiple responses that efficiently guides a following detailed analysis of certain responses and factors and contributes in designing subsequent experiments. The methodology is applied to a real industrial experiment and to a simulated data set with a larger number of responses and factors.},

In this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.},

Perhaps the only exception is in visualizing periodical time-dependent data, which is believed to be naturally supported by the radial layout. It has been demonstrated that the drawbacks of radial charts outweigh the benefits of this natural mapping. Visualization of daily patterns, as a special case, has not been systematically evaluated using radial charts. In contrast to yearly or weekly recurrent trends, the analysis of daily patterns on a radial chart may benefit from our trained skill on reading radial clocks that are ubiquitous in our culture. In a crowd-sourced experiment with 92 non-expert users, we evaluated the accuracy, efficiency, and subjective ratings of radial and linear charts for visualizing daily traffic accident patterns. We systematically compared juxtaposed 12-hours variants and single 24-hours variants for both layouts in four low-level tasks and one high-level interpretation task. Our results show that over all tasks, the most elementary 24-hours linear bar chart is most accurate and efficient and is also preferred by the users. This provides strong evidence for the use of linear layouts – even for visualizing periodical daily patterns.},

abstract = {Streamgraphs were popularized in 2008 when The New York Times used them to visualize box office revenues for 7500 movies over 21 years. The aesthetics of a streamgraph is affected by three components: the ordering of the layers, the shape of the lowest curve of the drawing, known as the baseline, and the labels for the layers. As of today, the ordering and baseline computation algorithms proposed in the paper of Byron and Wattenberg are still considered the state of the art. However, their ordering algorithm exploits statistical properties of the movie revenue data that may not hold in other data. In addition, the baseline optimization is based on a definition of visual energy that in some cases results in considerable amount of visual distortion. We offer an ordering algorithm that works well regardless of the properties of the input data, and propose a 1-norm based definition of visual energy and the associated solution method that overcomes the limitation of the original baseline optimization procedure. Furthermore, we propose an efficient layer labeling algorithm that scales linearly to the data size in place of the brute-force algorithm adopted by Byron and Wattenberg. We demonstrate the advantage of our algorithms over existing techniques on a number of real world data sets.},

	abstract = {Visualising data as diagrams using visual attributes such as colour, shape, size, and orientation is challenging. In particular, large data sets demand graphical display as an essential step in the analysis. In order to achieve comprehension often different attributes need to be displayed simultaneously. In this work a comprehensible bivariate, perceptually optimised visualisation scheme for high-dimensional data is proposed and evaluated. It can be used to show fold changes together with confidence values within a single diagram. The visualisation scheme consists of two parts: a uniform, symmetric, two-sided colour scale and a patch grid representation. Evaluation of uniformity and symmetry of the two-sided colour scale was performed in comparison to a standard RGB scale by twenty-five observers. Furthermore, the readability of the generated map was validated and compared to a bivariate heat map scheme.},

Here we conducted a systematic evaluation of its usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Major conclusions from this study are the following: (1) value-by-alpha maps are as effective and as efficient as area cartograms in bivariate mapping, but are generally less effective and efficient than bivariate proportional symbol maps, and (2) in terms of satisfaction, value-by-alpha maps are as popular as bivariate proportional symbol maps and are more popular than bivariate area cartograms.},

To mitigate and manage the pandemic, geographical information systems (GIS)-based spatial analysis has been used in a key role. To this aim, many GIS-based maps are produced by many national and international institutions. However, the produced maps are prepared by conventional methods and the features in these maps representing by their areal size. This paper proposes the diffusion-based cartograms for visualization of the COVID-19 outbreak. In the study, daily country-level data of the first 150 days of the COVID-19 outbreak were obtained from WHO, and the spread and spatial patterns of the epidemic were presented according to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. As a result of the study, it was observed that the cartogram is a powerful visualization tool and superior to the classical methods.},
